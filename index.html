        <h1>What is this game?</h1>
        <p>
          Blood on the Clocktower is a social game of deduction and
          deception, lies and logic, murder and mystery, for 5 to 20
          players. During the day, players talk and socialize as a group,
          or go into private conversations to gather information, share
          what they know, or spread lies. During the night, players
          close their eyes, whilst some good players wake to learn
          valuable information and the demon and its minions wake
          up to spread their mischief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each player is a unique character, with a powerful ability to
          use or a troublesome penalty to avoid. Clocktower is mostly
          a talking game, with almost no physical pieces for the
          players to use. Players win or lose by their wits, their insight,
          and their ability to convince others about who should live
          and who should die.
          Blood on the Clocktower games usually run for 30 to 90
          minutes, and you may find yourselves playing several games
          one after the other.

        <h1>Trouble Brewing</h1>
        <p>
          has a little bit of everything. Some characters passively receive
          information, some need to take action to learn who is who, while some
          simply want to bait the Demon into attacking them. Both good and evil
          can gain the upper hand by making well-timed sacrifices. Trouble
          Brewing is a relatively straightforward Demon-hunt, but evil has a
          number of dastardly misinformation tricks up their sleeves, so the
          good players best question what they think they know if they hope to
          survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginner. Recommended for players and Storytellers new to Blood on the
          Clocktower or to social deception games.

        <h1>Sects & Violets</h1>
        <p>
          is the craziest of the three editions included in the base set. Good
          characters get amazing information each and every night. However, the
          evil team is extremely varied and threatening and can throw massive
          confusion into the mix. Characters change alignment. Players change
          characters. Even the evil team can lose track of who is who. This is
          also the first appearance of madness, which throws all manner of
          spanners into the works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intermediate. Recommended for players who want to do wild and
          unexpected things, pushing the limits of what can be achieved in a
          bluffing game.

        <p>
          is a death extravaganza. Demons kill multiple times per night, and
          Minions get in on the action too. Good players can take great risks to
          gain reliable information, but may accidentally kill their friends in
          the process. Luckily, there are many options to keep players alive
          long past their use-by date. If the good team cannot determine which
          specific Minions and Demons are in play, however, their doom is all
          but certain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intermediate. Recommended for players who are proactive, dedicated to
          working as a team, and don’t fear dying.
